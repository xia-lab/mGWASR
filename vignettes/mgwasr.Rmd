# Overview

## Introduction

**mGWASR** contains the R functions and libraries underlying the
[mGWAS-Explorer](https://www.mgwas.ca/) web server. After installing and
loading the package, users will be able to reproduce the same results
from their local computers using the corresponding R command history
downloaded from mGWAS-Explorer, thereby achieving maximum flexibility
and reproducibility.

Following installation and loading of *mGWASR*, users will be able to
reproduce web server results from their local computers using the
corresponding R command history downloaded from mGWAS-Explorer, thereby
achieving maximum flexibility and reproducibility.

## Installation

**Step 1. Install package dependencies**

To use mGWASR , first install all package dependencies. Ensure that you
are able to download packages from bioconductor. To install package
dependencies, use the pacman R package (for those with \>R 3.5.1). Note
that some of these packages may require additional library dependencies
that need to be installed prior to their own successful installation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

library(pacman)
library(devtools)

# need to update the depdencies
pacman::p_load(RSQLite, igraph, BiocManager, BiocParallel,  pryr,  httr,  reshape,  ggplot2,  RJSONIO,  RCurl,  XML,  ggforce,  graphlayouts,  compiler,  dplyr,  RColorBrewer,  Cairo,  plyr,  qs,  rjson,  TwoSampleMR,
               mygene, myvariant, RMySQL, MendelianRandomization, VariantAnnotation)
devtools::install_github(c(
  "mglev1n/ldscr",
  "boxiangliu/locuscomparer",
  "explodecomputer/plinkbinr",
  "MRCIEU/genetics.binaRies",
  "mrcieu/gwasvcf",
  "mrcieu/gwasglue"
))

```

**Step 2. Install the package**

mGWASR is freely available from GitHub. The package documentation,
including the vignettes for each module and user manual is available
within the downloaded R package file. If all package dependencies were
installed, you will be able to install the mGWASR. Due to issues with
Latex, some users may find that they are only able to install mGWASR
without any documentation (i.e. vignettes).

Install the package directly from github using the *devtools* package.
Open R and enter:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install mGWASR WITHOUT documentation
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/mGWASR", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual", "--no-build-vignettes"), force = TRUE)

# Install mGWASR WITH documentation
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/mGWASR", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

# Tips for using the mGWASR package

1)  The first function that you will use in every module is the
    `InitDataObjects` function, which constructs the *dataSet* object
    that stores user's data for further processing and analysis.

2)  The mGWASR package directly creates data
    files/tables/analysis/networks outputs in your current working
    directory.

3)  Every command must be run in sequence, please do not skip any
    commands as this will result in errors downstream.

4)  Each main function in mGWASR is documented. Use the *?Function*
    format to open its documentation. For instance, use
    `?mGWASR::QueryExposure` to find out more about this function.

# Download SQLite database and PLINK binary file

The mGWASR package requires access to a SQLite database containing
curated mGWAS information and relies on PLINK for genetic analysis.

1.  **SQLite Database**: Contains 313,720 significant SNP-metabolite
    associations from 65 metabolite GWAS studies
2.  **PLINK**: Required for genetic analysis operations

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to use mGWASR is to set environment variables that allow
automatic downloading and configuration of dependencies.

``` r
# Load the library
library(mGWASR)
#### Set up file path
Sys.setenv(SQLITE_PATH = "/path/to/sqlite") #Example: "~/mGWAS_depend/"
Sys.setenv(PLINK_PATH = "/path/to/plink")

# Initiate the dataSet object for storing processed data

mSet <- InitDataObjects("met2snp")
```

When you run `InitDataObjects`, mGWASR will: 1. Check if the SQLite
database exists in the specified directory 2. If not found,
automatically download it (\~200MB) 3. Check if PLINK exists in the
specified directory 4. If not found, automatically download and make it
executable

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to manage dependencies manually:

1.  Download the SQLite database:

    ``` r
    # Create a directory to store the database
    dir.create("~/mgwas_data", showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

    # Download the database file
    download.file(
      "https://www.xialab.ca/rest/sqlite/mgwas_202201.sqlite", 
      "~/mgwas_data/mgwas_202201.sqlite", 
      mode = "wb"
    )
    ```

2.  Download PLINK:

    ``` r
    # Download PLINK
    download.file(
      "https://github.com/MRCIEU/genetics.binaRies/raw/refs/heads/master/binaries/Linux/plink",
      "~/mgwas_data/plink", 
      mode = "wb"
    )

    # Make PLINK executable
    Sys.chmod("~/mgwas_data/plink", "0755")
    ```

3.  Set environment variables and load the library:

    ``` r
    Sys.setenv(SQLITE_PATH = "~/mgwas_data")
    Sys.setenv(PLINK_PATH = "~/mgwas_data")
    ```

# Obtain statistical associations and biological mappings

## Starting from a list of metabolites

```{r, eval=FALSE}

SetAnalType("met2snp")
SetVepOpt("myvariant")
SetLDProxy("None")
SetLDR2("0.8")
mSet <- PerformCmpdMapping(mSet, "D-Glucose
Pyruvic acid
Betaine
L-Serine
Trimethylamine
Acetone
Acetic acid
2-Hydroxybutyric acid", "name", "blood", "all");
mSet <- CrossReferencing(mSet, "name");
mSet <- CreateMappingResultTable(mSetObj)
nms.vec <- "met2snp"
SetMappingType();
QueryMultiList();
# working till here

mSet<-CreateGraph(mSet, "metabolite")

```

Note, for users to prepare a list of metabolites, they can copy and
paste a list into a plain text file, which can then be uploaded to R.
These steps include: 1) Set working directory to location of your files
for analysis; 2) Set your list of features as "cmpdListFile" in
Rpkgdown::build_site()

3)  Read in the text file for analysis using readChar, saving it as
    "cmpdListFile"

## Starting from a list of item

# SNP-phenotype A-phenotype B causal hypothesis

Using a combination of fine-mapping and colocalization analysis, it is
possible to quickly determine the presence of genetic sharing (SNPs)
between multiple traits such as metabolite levels and disease. This
leads to the hypothesis that a certain SNP leads to phenotype B by
altering phenotype A, which can help to reveal the common genetic basis
of complex traits.

## get GWAS ID from ieu OpenGWAS database

Step 1: Obtain OpenGWAS API Token Before you can access the OpenGWAS
database, you need to get an API token. This token is required for
authentication and allows you to query the database. You can obtain the
token from <https://api.opengwas.io/>.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(OPENGWAS_JWT="your API token") # Replace "your API token" with the actual token you obtained
```

Step 2: Retrieve GWAS Information Once you have the API token, you can
use the `ieugwasr` package to fetch GWAS information. This package
provides functions to interact with the OpenGWAS database.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
allGWAS <- ieugwasr::gwasinfo() # This function retrieves a list of all available GWAS studies from the OpenGWAS database
```

Alternatively, you can load a pre-downloaded table of GWAS IDs from a
file included in the R package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
allGWAS_file <- system.file("extdata", "2024_allGWAS.csv", package = "mGWASR") # Locate the file within the package
allGWAS <- read.csv(allGWAS_file,row.names = 1) # Read the CSV file into a data frame
```

Explanation: The allGWAS data frame contains information about all GWAS
studies available in the OpenGWAS database, including their IDs, traits,
and other metadata.

## Find causal SNPs through finemap

The `findcausalSNP` function uses the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE)
model to identify causal SNPs based on two criteria: 1. PIP (Posterior
Inclusion Probability): The probability that each SNP is included in the
model. SNPs with PIP \> 0.8 (default) are considered candidate causal
SNPs. 2. Credible Sets (CSs): A set of SNPs whose cumulative PIP reaches
a certain confidence level (default 95%).

Step 1: Select the Region of Interest

To identify causal SNPs, you need to specify a genomic region of
interest. This region should be based on prior knowledge or hypotheses
about where causal variants might be located.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
region <- '11:58780549-62223771' # Example region on chromosome 11
```

Step 2: Search for Causal SNPs

Use the `findcausalSNP` function to search for causal SNPs within the
specified region for a specific GWAS study. You need to provide the GWAS
ID, the region, and the path to the binary file (`bfile`) containing the
genotype data.

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
causalsnp <- findcausalSNP(region,'ebi-a-GCST007515',threshold = 0.8, bfile = 'bfile/EUR') #Please specify the bfile file path
```

Explanation: This function returns a list of SNPs that both meet the
threshold above the PIP threshold and are members of CSs.

## Find co-localization relationships in large batches

Step 1: Extract GWAS IDs of Interest You may want to investigate
co-localization relationships between a specific phenotype and multiple
other phenotypes. First, extract the GWAS IDs of the phenotypes you are
interested in.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pheno2 <- allGWAS[stringr::str_detect(allGWAS$id, "met-a|met-c"),'id'] # Extract IDs of metabolite-related phenotypes
```

Step 2: Search for Co-localization Relationships Use the `batch_coloc`
function to search for co-localization relationships between the primary
phenotype and multiple secondary phenotypes. Specify the SNPs or chr:pos
and the region around them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
batch_coloc('ebi-a-GCST007515', pheno2, rsid_or_pos = c('rs174537','rs174547','rs1535'),region = 500000,output_dir = 'output_dir') #region is usually 500kb-2Mb
```

Explanation: Co-localization analysis helps determine whether the same
genetic variant influences multiple traits. The `region` parameter
defines the genomic window around the SNPs to search for
co-localization. A typical region is 500kb to 2Mb.

Alternatively, you can perform single co-localization and plot the
results for visualization. This is useful for detailed examination of
specific co-localization relationships.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
single_res <- colocal('ebi-a-GCST007515',pheno2[1],rsid_or_pos = 'rs174537',region = 500000,plot = T)
#Alternatively, you can use a VCF file
#single_res <- colocal('pheno1_vcf_file','pheno2_vcf_file',rsid_or_pos = casusalsnp[1],region = 500000,plot = T)
```

# Perform two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that uses genetic variants as
instrumental variables to establish a causal relationship between an
exposure (e.g., metabolite) and an outcome (e.g., disease). Two-sample
MR (2SMR) uses summary statistics from genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) for both the exposure and the outcome. In this tutorial, we will
guide you through performing two-sample MR in R using the *mGWASR*
package.

## Load and prepare exposure and outcome data

In two-sample MR, you need summary statistics from separate GWAS for
exposure and outcome. The dataset for the exposure should contain SNPs
that are significantly associated with the exposure. The dataset for the
outcome should contain the effects of these SNPs on the outcome. The
datasets must have columns for SNP, effect size, and standard error.

Load the exposure and outcome data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mSet<-InitDataObjects("mrmodule")
QueryExposure("Acetic acid")
QueryOutcome("ukb-b-4575")
```

```{=html}
<!-- ## Harmonize exposure and outcome data

Harmonizing the data ensures that the genetic variants are aligned
between the exposure and outcome datasets: -->
```

## Perform two-sample MR

```{r, eval=FALSE}
PerformMRAnalysis("no_ldclump", "true", "0.8", "true", "0.3", "2")
```

Here's a brief explanation of the commonly used methods you can choose:

1)  **Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) Method** (`mr_ivw`): The basic
    idea here is to use each genetic variant as a separate instrumental
    variable and to combine the individual causal effect estimates using
    a meta-analysis approach. The main assumption is that the genetic
    variants are valid instrumental variables, i.e., they are associated
    with the exposure, not associated with confounders of the
    exposure-outcome relationship, and affect the outcome only through
    the exposure.

-   **Pros**: It's the most common method, easy to understand, and
    provides precise estimates under ideal conditions.

-   **Cons**: It is sensitive to invalid instrumental variables
    (pleiotropy). In such cases, the results may be biased.

2)  **Weighted Median Method** (`mr_weighted_median`): This method
    calculates the median of the ratio estimates, but each ratio
    estimate is weighted by the inverse of its variance. This method
    provides a consistent estimate of the causal effect even when up to
    50% of the information comes from invalid instrumental variables
    (those that violate the MR assumptions). If the weighted median
    estimate is similar to the standard MR estimate, it suggests that
    the results are robust to violations of the MR assumptions by some
    of the genetic variants.

-   **Pros**: It provides a valid causal effect estimate even when up to
    50% of the weight in the analysis comes from invalid instrumental
    variables.

-   **Cons**: It is less efficient (i.e., has larger standard errors)
    than the IVW method when all genetic variants are valid instrumental
    variables.

3)  **MR-Egger Method** (`mr_egger_regression`): This method is similar
    to the IVW approach, but allows the intercept term in the regression
    model to be non-zero, which can be an indication of pleiotropy. This
    analysis allows for the potential existence of pleiotropy, where a
    single gene or genetic variant affects more than one trait. The
    intercept from the MR-Egger regression provides a measure of the
    average pleiotropic effect across all genetic variants. A non-zero
    intercept can indicate directional pleiotropy, which could bias the
    MR estimates. The slope in MR-Egger regression provides a causal
    estimate that is corrected for pleiotropy.

-   **Pros**: It can provide an unbiased estimate even when all genetic
    variants are invalid, as long as the pleiotropic effects of the
    genetic variants are uncorrelated with their associations with the
    exposure.

-   **Cons**: It is less efficient than the IVW and weighted median
    methods and may have low statistical power.

4)  **Wald ratio** (`mr_wald_ratio`): The Wald Ratio is one of the most
    straightforward methods. In the Wald ratio method, each genetic
    variant is used as an instrumental variable, and the causal effect
    of the exposure on the outcome is estimated as the ratio of the
    genetic association with the outcome to the genetic association with
    the exposure. This is done for each genetic variant, and then the
    results can be combined across genetic variants, for example by
    taking the average.

-   **Pros**: The Wald ratio is simple to calculate and easy to
    interpret. It does not require complex statistical modeling or
    software.

-   **Cons**: Assumptions: The Wald ratio assumes that the genetic
    variant is associated with the exposure, does not affect the outcome
    through any pathway other than the exposure (no horizontal
    pleiotropy), and is not associated with any confounders of the
    exposure-outcome relationship. If these assumptions are violated,
    the Wald ratio may give biased estimates. Sensitivity to weak
    instruments: The Wald ratio can give imprecise estimates if the
    genetic variant is weakly associated with the exposure, which can be
    a particular problem when there is only one genetic variant
    available as an instrumental variable.

The choice of method will depend on the specific context of the
analysis. If you strongly believe that the genetic variants are valid
instrumental variables, the IVW or Wald ratio method would be good
choices. If you are unsure about the validity of the instrumental
variables, the weighted median or MR-Egger method might be more
appropriate. However, it's often a good idea to use several methods and
compare the results to assess the robustness of your findings. If the
different methods give similar results, this can increase your
confidence in the causal effect estimate.

To perform the two-sample MR analysis, choose an appropriate MR method
(e.g., inverse variance weighted [IVW] method). Run the analysis using
the selected method:

## Perform directionality analysis

## Perform sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses in Two-Sample MR are essential to validate the main
findings and to assess the robustness of the MR estimates against
violations of the key assumptions. Here are the most common sensitivity
analyses in Two-Sample MR and how to interpret their results:

-   Heterogeneity test: Testing for heterogeneity in a 2SMR analysis
    involves assessing whether the causal effect estimates from
    different SNPs are consistent with each other.

    The `mr_heterogeneity()` function returns a list with the following
    components:

    -   Q: The Cochran's Q statistic, which is a measure of the weighted
        sum of squared differences between individual SNP estimates and
        the overall MR estimate. A large Q statistic relative to its
        degrees of freedom suggests heterogeneity.

    -   Q_df: The degrees of freedom, which is equal to the number of
        SNPs minus 1.

    -   Q_pval: The p-value for the Q statistic. A low p-value (e.g.,
        less than 0.05) suggests that there is significant
        heterogeneity.

-   Pleiotropy test: This test is based on MR-Egger regression and
    specifically tests the null hypothesis that the intercept from the
    MR-Egger regression is equal to zero. If the null hypothesis is
    rejected, it suggests that there is horizontal pleiotropy, meaning
    that the genetic variants used as instrumental variables affect the
    outcome through pathways that are not mediated by the exposure.

    The `mr_pleiotropy_test()` function returns a list with the
    following components:

    -   pval: The p-value for the intercept from the MR-Egger
        regression. A low p-value (e.g., less than 0.05) suggests that
        there is significant horizontal pleiotropy.

    -   egger_intercept: The intercept from the MR-Egger regression,
        which provides a measure of the average pleiotropic effect
        across all genetic variants.

-   intercept_stderr: The standard error of the intercept.

If the p-value (pval) is less than a certain significance level (e.g.,
0.05), it suggests that there is significant pleiotropy. This means that
at least some of the genetic variants used as instrumental variables are
affecting the outcome through pathways that are not mediated by the
exposure, which could bias the MR estimates.

## Interpret results

**Review the table results**

The output will display the causal estimate, its standard error, and the
p-value. A significant p-value (\< 0.05) suggests a causal relationship
between exposure and outcome.

**Scatter plot**

The scatter plot in a MR analysis is typically used to visualize the
relationship between genetic associations with the exposure (on the
x-axis) and the outcome (on the y-axis). Each point on the plot
represents a single genetic variant (also known as a single nucleotide
polymorphism or SNP).

Here's how you interpret the scatter plot:

1)  Slope and Linearity: The slope of the line fitted through the points
    is an estimate of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome.
    If the points are scattered around a straight line with a positive
    slope, it suggests that an increase in exposure is associated with
    an increase in the outcome, indicating a positive causal effect.
    Conversely, if the points are scattered around a straight line with
    a negative slope, it suggests that an increase in exposure is
    associated with a decrease in the outcome, indicating a negative
    causal effect.

2)  Scatter around the line: If the points are closely clustered around
    the line, it suggests that the genetic variants are good instruments
    (i.e., they satisfy the assumptions of MR). If the points are widely
    scattered, it suggests potential violation of the MR assumptions,
    such as presence of pleiotropy (where a single gene affects more
    than one trait), or measurement error.

3)  Outliers: Outliers are points that lie far from the line of best
    fit. These might represent genetic variants that have pleiotropic
    effects, or that are affected by measurement error or linkage
    disequilibrium (where genetic variants are inherited together more
    often than would be expected by chance). Outliers can bias the MR
    estimate, so it's important to consider sensitivity analyses (like
    MR-Egger regression or leave-one-out analysis) that can help assess
    the impact of potential outliers on the MR results.

**Forest plot**

A forest plot in a 2SMR analysis provides a visual representation of the
causal effect estimates for each SNP, as well as the overall causal
effect estimate.

Here's how you interpret a forest plot in MR analysis:

1)  Individual SNP estimates: Each horizontal line in the forest plot
    represents one SNP. The point on the line indicates the estimated
    causal effect of the exposure on the outcome for that SNP. The
    length of the line represents the confidence interval for that
    estimate.

2)  Overall MR estimate: This is usually represented at the bottom of
    the plot. The center of the point represents the combined estimate
    of the causal effect across all SNPs (i.e., the overall MR
    estimate), and the width of the point represents the confidence
    interval for the overall estimate.

3)  Direction of effect: If the point estimates are mostly on the right
    side of the line of no effect (usually represented by a vertical
    line at 0), it suggests that the exposure increases the risk of the
    outcome. If they're mostly on the left side, it suggests that the
    exposure decreases the risk of the outcome.

4)  Heterogeneity: If the individual SNP estimates are widely scattered,
    it suggests that there is heterogeneity in the causal estimates.

5)  Influence of individual SNPs: If removing one SNP from the analysis
    changes the overall MR estimate substantially, it suggests that the
    SNP may be exerting undue influence on the results.

**Leave-one-out plot**

The leave-one-out (LOO) analysis is a sensitivity analysis used in MR.
It assesses the influence of each individual SNP on the overall causal
effect estimate. In this analysis, the MR is rerun multiple times, each
time leaving out one SNP, to see how much the overall estimate changes.

Here's how you interpret a leave-one-out plot in MR analysis:

1)  Influence of individual SNPs: Each point on the LOO plot represents
    the overall MR estimate obtained when that SNP is excluded from the
    analysis. If removing a particular SNP changes the overall MR
    estimate substantially, it suggests that this SNP may be exerting
    undue influence on the results.

2)  Consistency of the MR estimate: If all the points on the LOO plot
    are close to the overall MR estimate, it suggests that the MR
    estimate is consistent and not unduly influenced by any single SNP.

3)  Identifying outlier SNPs: If there are one or more points that are
    far from the overall MR estimate, these are outlier SNPs that may be
    violating the assumptions of MR. These SNPs might be worth further
    investigation to understand why they are outliers.

4)  Confidence intervals: The LOO plot usually also shows the confidence
    intervals for each leave-one-out MR estimate. If these intervals
    overlap substantially, it suggests that the MR results are robust to
    the exclusion of individual SNPs.

**Funnel plot**

A funnel plot in a 2SMR analysis is used to assess potential bias in the
causal effect estimates, often due to pleiotropy. The plot is a scatter
plot of the precision of each SNP's causal effect estimate (on the
y-axis) against the estimate itself (on the x-axis).

Here's how you interpret a funnel plot in MR analysis:

1)  Symmetry: In the absence of bias, the plot should be symmetrical
    around the vertical line that represents the overall causal effect
    estimate. This is because each SNP's estimate is expected to vary
    randomly around the true causal effect, with higher precision
    estimates (those closer to the top of the plot) varying less than
    lower precision estimates (those closer to the bottom). If the plot
    is asymmetrical, it suggests that there may be bias in the MR
    estimates.

2)  Direction of bias: If the points on the plot are mostly to the right
    of the overall estimate, it suggests that there is positive bias
    (i.e., the estimates are skewed towards positive values). If the
    points are mostly to the left, it suggests that there is negative
    bias (i.e., the estimates are skewed towards negative values).

3)  Pleiotropy: Asymmetry in the funnel plot can be a sign of
    pleiotropy, where a gene influences the outcome through more than
    one pathway. This violates one of the key assumptions of MR and can
    bias the results.

4)  Heterogeneity and outliers: A widely scattered plot or the presence
    of outlier points far from the vertical line can indicate
    heterogeneity in the causal estimates or the presence of outlier
    SNPs, which could be due to pleiotropy, linkage disequilibrium, or
    measurement error. These SNPs might be worth further investigation.

5)  Precision: Points towards the top of the plot are SNPs with higher
    precision estimates (smaller standard errors), while points towards
    the bottom are SNPs with lower precision estimates (larger standard
    errors).

# Batch estimation of heritability and genetic correlation

Perform LDSC analysis in batches conveniently to estimate heritability
and genetic correlation Step 1: Download GWAS Sumstats To perform LDSC
(Linkage Disequilibrium Score) analysis, you need GWAS summary
statistics in the standard VCF format. Use the "download_ieuvcf"
function to download the required files, or you can prepare them
yourself.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
phenos <- allGWAS %>%
  filter(grepl("Type 2 diabetes", trait, ignore.case = TRUE) & population == "European")
download_ieuvcf(phenos$id,'T2D_EUR_vcf/') # Download VCF files for these studies
```

Step 2: Filter Successful Downloads Check which files were successfully
downloaded and filter out any failed downloads.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
phenos <- download_status %>%
  filter(status == "Success")
```

Step 3: Convert VCF Files to LDSC required Format Convert the downloaded
VCF files to the intermediate RDS format required for LDSC analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ldsc_file <- vcf2ldsc('T2D_EUR_vcf/',saveRDS = T,output_dir = 'T2D_EUR_vcf_rds',num_cores = 5)
```

Step 4: Batch Calculate Heritability Use the `batch_ldsc_h2` function to
estimate the heritability of each phenotype.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ldsc_h2 <- batch_ldsc_h2('T2D_EUR_vcf_rds/',num_cores = 8)
```

Step 5: Calculate Genetic Correlation Pair all phenotypes and calculate
the genetic correlation between each pair.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ldsc_res <- pair_ldsc('T2D_EUR_vcf_rds/',output_dir = 'T2D_EUR_res/',para_plan  = 'multicore',num_cores = 8)
```

Step 6: Merge and Filter Results Combine the results and filter them
based on specific conditions to create a table for visualization.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
com_res <- combine_filter('T2D_EUR_res/',traits = c('ebi-a-GCST005047.vcf',
  'ebi-a-GCST005413.vcf',
  'ieu-a-1090.vcf',
  'ukb-b-13806.vcf',
  'ebi-a-GCST007517.vcf'))
```

Step 7: Plot Correlation Heatmap Visualize the genetic correlation
results using a heatmap.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot <- cor_plot(com_res)
```

Explanation: The LDSC analysis function of this package provides an
interface for calculating the heritability and genetic correlation of
standardized vcf sumstats.

# Reproduce the results of the T2D case study

This section is used to reproduce the results of the case study of T2D
in the article, which may take a long time.

Step 1: Obtain GWAS ID

Load the GWAS information from the pre-downloaded file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
allGWAS_file <- system.file("extdata", "2024_allGWAS.csv", package = "mGWASR")
allGWAS <- read.csv(allGWAS_file,row.names = 1)
```

Step 2: Find Causal SNPs through Fine-Mapping Specify multiple genomic
regions of interest. Here are the top 10 regions related to metabolites
after data mining in the article.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
region <- c("11:58780549-62223771", "11:116383348-117747110", "19:44744108-46102697", 
  "11:59251804-62201641", "15:58441366-59694116", "1:54226262-56413117", 
  "11:116383543-117901740", "16:55903774-57664330", "2:26894985-28598777", 
  "8:19492840-20060856")
```

Searching for causal SNPs of a specific GWAS (Type 2 diabetes,
ebi-a-GCST007515) in regions of interest.

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
causalsnp <- findcausalSNP(region,'ebi-a-GCST007515',threshold = 0.8, bfile = 'bfile/EUR') #Please specify the bfile file path
#Preserve unique SNPs
causalsnp <- unlist(strsplit(na.omit(c(as.matrix(causalsnp))), ",\\s*"))
```

Step 3: Find Co-localization Relationships in Large Batches Extract GWAS
IDs starting with met-a or met-c (metabolite GWAS provided by the IEU)
that are to be compared with T2D.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pheno2 <- allGWAS[stringr::str_detect(allGWAS$id, "met-a|met-c"),'id']
```

Step 5: Search for Co-localization Relationships Use the `batch_coloc`
function to search for co-localization relationships between T2D and
hundreds of metabolites.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
batch_coloc('ebi-a-GCST007515', pheno2, rsid_or_pos = causalsnp,region = 500000,output_dir = 'output_dir') #Region specified as 500kb
```

Step 6: Perform Single Co-localization and Plot Individually examine and
visualize results between Type 2 diabetes (ebi-a-GCST007515) and Total
fatty acids (met-c-936).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
single_res <- colocal('ebi-a-GCST007515','met-c-936',rsid_or_pos = 'rs769449',region = 500000,plot = T)
#Alternatively, you can use a VCF file
#single_res <- colocal('pheno1_vcf_file','pheno2_vcf_file',rsid_or_pos = casusalsnp[1],region = 500000,plot = T)
```
